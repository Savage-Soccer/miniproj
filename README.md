We outline our framework built upon Mask R-CNN â€“ an object
detection framework, EasyOCR for text recognition and Stable
Diffusion for high-quality image inpainting as described earlier.
We introduce several enhancements over the classical inpainting problems including spatially adaptive mask pre-processing,
scene-aware prompt shaping, and a three-stage refinement process that merges multiple approaches. Testing shows that the
technique achieves perfect congruence with the natural contours
of the image, allowing seamless blending with the background
elements. Our methods exceed those of previous one-stage inpainting techniques, even for intricate structures and artificial
patterns. The system provides simple graphical interfaced tools
where objects or text can be interactively removed from images
with minimal mouse movement by the user.
